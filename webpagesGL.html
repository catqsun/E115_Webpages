	<p>Hello! My name is Cathy Sun, and I am a <em>current</em> 2nd year student here a NC State University. 
	I originally transferred from UNC Charlotte which is why I'm currently taking this class as a sophomore.
	I am originally from Toronto, Canada but I have also lived in California
	and currently live in Cary, NC. I am a <ins>computer science</ins> major so I really enjoy E115 as it gives me a chance to
	explore a lot of different types of <strong>computing skills</strong> such as html! 
	</p>
	<p>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH is my favourite <del>element</del> chemical formula. E = mc<sup>2</sup> is my favourite physics formula.</p>
