	<p>Hello! My name is Cathy Sun, and I am a current 2nd year student here a NC State University. 
	I originally transferred from UNC Charlotte which is why I'm currently taking this class as a sophomore.
	I am originally from Toronto, Canada but I have also lived in California
	and currently live in Cary, NC. I am a computer science major so I really enjoy E115 as it gives me a chance to
	explore a lot of different types of computing skills such as html!
