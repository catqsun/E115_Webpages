    <!-- Question #3: Paragraph 1 -->
	<p>Hi! My name is Cathy Sun and I am a 2nd year student majoring in Computer Science. I chose this major because I really enjoy programming. I like how methodical it is and how satisfying it is to see your code compile after
	all the hours of work. Its also incredibly rewarding to interact with the final product and see the finctionality of the code translated into something visual like a gui. In addition, the field offers such a wide variety 
	of different opportunities which leaves a lot of options to choose from for my future.</p>
	<br />
    <!-- Question 3: Paragraph 2 -->
    <p>I currently do not have a job as it would be hard for me to balance with my school work. However, I hope to be able to get an internship this summer with a tech company possibly in the RTP. In the future I also hope
	to co-op so that I can be more prepared for when I graduate.</p>
